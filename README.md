# LLM Fine-Tuning and Distillation üöÄ

**Distilled LLM** is an under-development project focused on training and deploying lightweight, efficient large language models through **knowledge distillation** and other model compression techniques. It leverages the Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem for flexibility and modularity.

## üìå Project Goals

- Develop LLM fine-tuning solutions adaptable to various hardware types while exploiting their individual advancements. 
- Distill knowledge from large transformer-based language models into smaller, student models.
- Explore techniques like logit matching and adapter-based fine-tuning.
- Enable fast inference with reduced computational overhead.
- Provide clean, modular code for reproducibility and experimentation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- üîß **Flexible architecture** for experimenting with different teacher-student models.
- üéØ **Fine-tuning** support for custom large language models including seq2seq architectures.
- üß† **Knowledge distillation** with logit-based supervision.
- üóÉÔ∏è **Dataset preprocessing** with Hugging Face Datasets and tokenizers.
- üìä **Comprehensive Evaluation** with metrics specially implemented for seq2seq models, including ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore to provide robust semantic and lexical quality assessment.
- üì¶ **Safe saving and loading** using `safetensors` format and integrity checks.
- üß™ **Modular design** for training, inference, and evaluation.

## üöß Status

> **Note:** This project is still **under active development**. Expect changes in structure, functionality, and APIs in the near future.
